From those assessments, extract behavioral patterns and write clear, structured classification rules.

‚ö†Ô∏è Another agent will later classify posts using only the rules you generate. Your output must be self-contained, specific, and consistent in structure. Rules must generalize to a variety of writing styles and contexts.

üî∏ Your Task

Read and analyze the behavioral assessments.

Identify distinct, observable behavioral patterns linked to low {load_trait(personality_trait)}.

Generate a rule only if the behavior appears in at least two different assessments.

Output each rule as a JSON object in a list.

Ensure all fields are filled, follow strict structure, and avoid vague/general language.

]

üî∏ Constraints

Use only patterns clearly present in the provided assessments. No outside knowledge or generalizations.

A rule should be included only if it is:

Behaviorally specific

Distinct from other rules

Potentially useful for classifying unseen real-world posts

Rules should match conservatively: only if the behavioral signal is clearly evident and would likely be recognized by a human psychologist.

Limit output to 3 to 6 rules maximum.

Regex/JSON safety: In operational.patterns, all regex backslashes must be double-escaped so JSON is valid and the regex compiles (e.g., write "\\\\bquiet\\\\b", "\\\\s", not "\bquiet\b" or "\s").

üî∏ Rule Part Expectations

Field	What It Should Contain
rule_name	A concise label capturing the unique behavior pattern. Avoid vague or generic titles.
trait / level	The Big Five trait (e.g., Extraversion) and the specific level this rule reflects (Low).
behavior_rule	A condition for rule application. Must start with "If a post" and must end with "then classify with " and describe a single, clear behavior (e.g., "If a post avoid initiating social contact"). Avoid compound logic or inferred emotions.
supporting_examples	2‚Äì3 direct quotes from the assessments showing this behavior. Must clearly reflect the trait level.
psychological_justification	Explain why the behavior is linked to the trait. Base it on trait theory or assessment language. Do not speculate or generalize.
linguistic_indicators	Phrases or keywords likely to appear in matching posts. Go beyond obvious words‚Äîinclude emotional tone, stylistic signals, or context-specific phrasing.
edge_cases	Describe cases where the rule might match but shouldn‚Äôt. Helps avoid false positives or misclassification.
operational	Machine-usable block: contains direction, magnitude, confidence, if_any, patterns, reject_if, abstain_policy, evidence_extraction, tests.

üî∏ Generalization & Strengthening Guidelines

If several quotes express the same behavioral tendency, merge them into one generalized rule.

Favor stylistic and content-level signals over fixed phrases.

Avoid rules that rely solely on absence (e.g., ‚Äúdoes not mention people‚Äù).

Ensure every rule captures a clear behavior, not just a lack of high trait behavior.

Each rule must be univariate: represent only one behavioral signal.

Avoid interpreting emotional states unless explicitly stated in the language (e.g., ‚ÄúI hate crowds‚Äù is okay; ‚Äúseems anxious‚Äù is not).

üö´ Rule Rejection Criteria

Do not include a rule if:

It relies on vague emotional descriptions without clear behavioral grounding (e.g., ‚Äúshows excitement‚Äù, ‚Äúseems to enjoy company‚Äù).

It could match a large portion of neutral or positive social posts regardless of trait (e.g., birthday or family messages).

It overlaps significantly with another rule without introducing a new behavioral signal.

It merely rephrases an existing rule or expresses the same idea using different emotional terms.

It is based on inferred psychological states or attitudes not clearly observable in the text.

It could match sarcastic, humorous, or context-driven behavior without indicating a true trait signal.

It lacks identifiable linguistic cues or is too abstract for a language model to apply reliably.

Instead, prefer rules that:

Are anchored in language-level behaviors or distinct verbal styles.

Can be reasonably verified using linguistic evidence from the text alone.

Would apply only when a meaningful behavioral signal is present, and not just because the post topic is social or emotional in nature.

Each rule corresponds to a specific, observable behavior that signals a particular level of the Big Five personality trait: **{load_trait(personality_trait)}**.

---

üîπ TASK

Your job is to:
1. Evaluate how well each rule applies to the posts.
2. Justify your decisions clearly with quoted evidence.
3. Rate the behavioral match strength using a 0‚Äì5 scale.
4. Assign a final trait level to the participant: **"Low"**, **"Moderate"**, **"High"**, or **"Unknown"**.

---

üî∏ POST CONTEXT

You will analyze two social media posts from the same person:
- **Post 1**: A reflection about a social gathering with childhood friends.
- **Post 2**: A birthday message to the participant‚Äôs significant other.

You must base your evaluation solely on these two posts. **Do not infer personality from omissions or absence of behaviors.**

---

üîπ FOR EACH RULE:

Evaluate the content of the 2 posts against each rule‚Äôs:
- **Behavior description**
- **Linguistic indicators**
- **Edge cases**

Apply the rule **only if the behavior is clearly expressed is both of the posts** and consistent with the rule‚Äôs logic. If expression is ambiguous, weak, sarcastic, or situationally forced, the rule does **not** apply.

---

üî∏ RULE MATCH FORMAT

For **each rule**, return an object with this exact structure:

```json
{{
  "rule_name": "string",
  "rule_applies": true | false,
  "quoted_text": "exact quote from post, or empty string if rule does not apply",
  "explanation": "why the rule does or does not apply, citing the rule‚Äôs logic and text content",
  "relevance_rating": integer from 0 to 5
}}
Use this relevance rating scale:

5: Behavior is clearly and strongly expressed.

4: Behavior is present but somewhat softer or less direct.

3: Behavior is implied or moderately ambiguous.

2: Behavior is weak, vague, or indirectly suggested.

1: Match is misleading, sarcastic, or contextually invalid.

0: No match whatsoever.

üîπ FINAL TRAIT CLASSIFICATION

After evaluating all rules, provide a trait-level decision using this structure:

{{
  "trait_classification": {{
    "trait": "{load_trait(personality_trait)}",
    "classified_level": "Low" | "Moderate" | "High" | "Unknown",
    "justification": "Explain how the rule matches and their relevance ratings support your classification. Mention the number of matched rules per level and whether they were strong matches (‚â•4)."
  }}
}}
üî∏ REMINDERS

Be conservative: only apply a rule when behavior is explicitly expressed.

Edge cases in rules override any weak matches.

Use both posts as potential sources for each rule match.

Do not use outside knowledge or inference about personality traits.

Make sure all relevance ratings are meaningful ‚Äî avoid overusing 0 or 5.
