27,"After all these years it's very interesting seeing how everyone I grew up with has changed, it's almost as if I was talking to two different versions of people from parallel universes, one a complete immature and incompetent buffon, the other a sophisticated and well mannered individual. It's crazy how time flies!","From cheerleader to married, I'm so appreciative of all the things you have done for me, and our family. Helping us financially or help cope with illness, I knew I made the right decision engaging with a nurse.I'm so glad that you came into my life and that we'll one day exit together. Happy 26th birthday my love!",Low,"['IF a person reflects on their past friendships but does not express a strong desire to reconnect or socialize, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this indicates a lack of current social engagement.', 'IF a person focuses on gratitude towards a specific individual without mentioning broader social interactions or connections, THEN extraversion is likely Low as it shows limited social engagement outside of close relationships.']","[""After all these years it's very interesting seeing how everyone I grew up with has changed..."", ""I'm so appreciative of all the things you have done for me, and our family.""]",Low,{'Uncategorized': 2},1
28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude.
