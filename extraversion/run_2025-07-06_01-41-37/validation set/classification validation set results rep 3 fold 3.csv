28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude. Get writing that bucket list and let's see the world ticking them off.,Low,"['IF a person shows in a post a preference for quiet evenings and focuses on solitary activities or reflections THEN extraversion is likely Low because this indicates a tendency towards introversion.', 'IF a person shows in a post a consistent reference to past experiences rather than looking forward to new ones THEN extraversion is likely Low because this implies a focus on reminiscence rather than seeking new social opportunities.', 'IF a person shows in a post feelings of distance or reservation in interactions with others THEN extraversion is likely Low because this suggests discomfort in social environments.']","['Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged.', 'Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious.', ""Unfortunately it's all downhill from here.""]",High,Low,{'Sociability': 3},1,0
