32,"A great thank you to my best childhood friends for organising this heart-warming event.

28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude.

39,"Had an amazing night catching up with my childhood friends! It’s been way too long since we all got together. We reminisced about our wild adventures and laughed until our sides hurt.

53,"As I sit with my childhood friends, the years seem to melt away. The familiar banter, the inside jokes that we’ve carried like treasures through the years, and the way we all seem to pick up right where we left off—it’s like time stands still. I catch myself laughing more freely, feeling that easy comfort I once did when the world seemed so simple. There’s something about being with people who know you in your purest form, before the world shaped you in its various ways.

The conversation flows from old memories—those endless summer days, the mischief we got into, the places we’d hide out—and then shifts to where life has taken us. There’s a warmth in seeing how far we’ve all come, and yet, we’re still those same people at our core. It’s a reminder of roots, of the strength and depth of bonds that time and distance can never fully sever. Even as we talk about new chapters and changes, I realize how much of my past is written in the pages of these friendships.

It feels like being wrapped in a blanket of shared history, and for a moment, I feel grounded again—anchored in who I was, who I am, and who I will always be to these people. The laughter, the ease, the nostalgia—it’s all a kind of reminder that some things, like friendship, never truly change.","Another year with you feels like a gift I get to unwrap every single day. Watching you grow, laugh, and be the incredible person you are fills me with so much pride and gratitude. You are my heart, my best friend, and the person who makes everything brighter just by being you. ??

Thank you for the countless memories we’ve already made and the many more to come. Here’s to celebrating you today (and always), to all your dreams coming true, and to the endless adventures ahead. I’m beyond lucky to walk through life with you by my side. ????

You deserve all the happiness in the world, today and always. I love you more than words could ever say. ?? #BirthdayQueen/King #LuckyToCallYouMine",Moderate,"['IF a person shows in a post a tendency to reminisce about past social experiences without eagerness for new ones, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this reflects a disengagement from new social opportunities.', 'IF a person shows in a post a focus on solitary activities and does not emphasize social interactions, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this indicates a preference for low social engagement.', 'IF a person shows in a post references to spending time with a limited number of friends and expresses minimal enthusiasm, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this indicates a preference for fewer social interactions.']","['I catch myself laughing more freely, feeling that easy comfort I once did when the world seemed so simple.', ""It's like time stands still."", 'the familiar banter, the inside jokes that we’ve carried like treasures through the years.']",High,Low,{'Sociability': 3},0,0
