28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude. Get writing that bucket list and let's see the world ticking them off.,Low,"['IF a person posts about enjoying nights out with a group of people THEN extraversion is likely High because it indicates engagement in social activities.', 'IF a person describes spending time with a group of friends and expresses happiness about it THEN extraversion is likely High because it reflects enjoyment of social interactions.', ""IF a person discusses friendship openly and expresses feelings about their partner's attractiveness publicly THEN extraversion is likely High because it shows comfort in sharing personal feelings in social contexts."", 'IF a person expresses excitement and enjoyment about social events in an upbeat tone with exclamations Then extraversion is likely High because it indicates enthusiasm for social interactions.']","['My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school.', 'We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event.', 'The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today.', 'Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together.']",High,High,"{'Sociability': 2, 'Warmth': 1, 'Positive Emotions': 1}",0,0
