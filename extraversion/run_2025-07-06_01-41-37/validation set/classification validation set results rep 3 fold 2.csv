35,Had a great catchup with my old friends today. It had been too long since we had last spoke with each other. Met up at a local pub and had some nice drinks and a great dinner. There was a show on across the road and we jumped over there after a few beers. Thanks for organising it guys and let's not wait too long for the next one! ,"Happy birthday, babe! Where has the year gone? It felt like only last month we were talking about our plans for the year and now nearly a whole other year has gone by. Don't feel too worked up about your age because I know it gets to you, sometimes. We'll go out and enjoy ourselves and treat it like an 18th to make you happy.
