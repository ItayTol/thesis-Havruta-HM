28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude. Get writing that bucket list and let's see the world ticking them off.,Low,"['IF a person describes enjoying nights out with a group of people in a post THEN extraversion is likely High because this indicates a preference for social interactions and engagement.', ""IF a person makes posts filled with positivity and mentions 'lots of laughs' during social gatherings THEN extraversion is likely High because this suggests enjoyment and engagement with social activities."", 'IF a person expresses a desire for frequent socializing and making memories with others in their posts THEN extraversion is likely High because this indicates a preference for social environments.', 'IF a person includes exclamatory phrases and expresses a love for dynamic experiences with friends in their posts THEN extraversion is likely High because this reflects excitement and joy in social scenarios.', 'IF a person describes adventures and wild stories involving friends in a lively manner THEN extraversion is likely High because this suggests an eagerness to engage in social activities.']","['My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school.', 'Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged.', 'We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event.', 'Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together.', ""Let's see the world ticking them off.""]",High,High,"{'Sociability': 2, 'Uncategorized': 1, 'Positive Emotions': 1, 'Energy/Activity': 1}",0,0
