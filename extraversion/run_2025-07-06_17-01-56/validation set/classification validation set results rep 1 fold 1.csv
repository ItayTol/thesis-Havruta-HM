28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude. Get writing that bucket list and let's see the world ticking them off.,Low,"['IF a person shows in a post a focus on long-standing friendships without interest in meeting new people, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this indicates a preference for familiar social circles over new interactions.', 'IF a person shows in a post a reflective tone focusing on introspective thoughts rather than social activities, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this indicates a preference for solitude or contemplation.', 'IF a person shows in a post a subdued tone with less energetic language and expressions, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this suggests a lack of enthusiasm for social interaction.']","['My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school.', ""Unfortunately it's all downhill from here."", 'Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling.']",High,Low,"{'Sociability': 2, 'Energy/Activity': 1}",1,0

6,today guys I have reunited with my childhood friends and I was so excited. it was an amazing experience which I totally recommend if you can do it as the feeling of meeting someone you used to play with when you talked to them is unforgettable.

19,"So exciting to catch up with everyone! Being in our thirties means meeting up takes at least ten conversations about the event, at least one cancellation, minimum two babies and a stray husband.
