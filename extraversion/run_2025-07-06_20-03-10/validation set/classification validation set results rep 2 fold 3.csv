Emily, Sandra and Beckie - you are the best! 
Lots of stories and pictures were shared and we all thoroughly enjoyed a crazy ride down memory lane. It was great to see you all and see how you all got on in your lives girls!
Can't wait to do this again next year!","A very Happy birthday to my bestie!!! Roy, I want you to know that you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I am so glad we met and I love you unconditionally. I hope you have the best day celebrating your 40th birthday and I'm so here for it. 
You have touched the lives of so many people including mine and we are forever grateful for your optimistic, caring, and kind personality, hope you'll never change!

6,today guys I have reunited with my childhood friends and I was so excited. it was an amazing experience which I totally recommend if you can do it as the feeling of meeting someone you used to play with when you talked to them is unforgettable.

19,"So exciting to catch up with everyone! Being in our thirties means meeting up takes at least ten conversations about the event, at least one cancellation, minimum two babies and a stray husband. Glad this one made it out of the group chat. To next time; hopefully it doesn't take eight months ;)","Turning 30 has never looked better. Spending our twenties together was incredible; the highs, the lows, but most importantly being with you. So excited to spend the rest of my life with you. Happy birthday to the love of my life.
