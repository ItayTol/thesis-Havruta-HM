28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude. Get writing that bucket list and let's see the world ticking them off.,Low,"['IF a person shows in a post a pattern of reminiscing about past experiences rather than discussing new social events, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this reflects a preference for past memories over current social engagement.', 'IF a person shows in a post a preference for quiet evenings focused on food rather than social aspects, THEN extraversion is likely Low because this indicates a lack of engagement with social interactions.']","['Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious.', ""Unfortunately it's all downhill from here.

","40 today! Happy birthday to S. At what point do you think people will stop saying ""but you look about 12""? ?? Have a great day and I'll see you later for the birthday surprise.

We finally met up after so long - It was so lovely to catch up with all of you. It has been way too long since we last saw each other, and it really good to hear that you're all doing well.
