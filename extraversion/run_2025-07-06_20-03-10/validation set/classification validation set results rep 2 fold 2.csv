28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude. Get writing that bucket list and let's see the world ticking them off.,Low,"['IF a person describes social experiences with enjoyment in a post THEN extraversion is likely High because the positive engagement indicates a preference for social interaction.', 'IF a person expresses excitement about plans or gatherings in a post THEN extraversion is likely High because the enthusiasm suggests enjoyment in social activities.']","['We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event.', ""Let's see the world ticking them off.""]",High,High,"{'Sociability': 1, 'Positive Emotions': 1}",0,0
