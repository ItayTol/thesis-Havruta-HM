53,"As I sit with my childhood friends, the years seem to melt away. The familiar banter, the inside jokes that we’ve carried like treasures through the years, and the way we all seem to pick up right where we left off—it’s like time stands still. I catch myself laughing more freely, feeling that easy comfort I once did when the world seemed so simple. There’s something about being with people who know you in your purest form, before the world shaped you in its various ways.

The conversation flows from old memories—those endless summer days, the mischief we got into, the places we’d hide out—and then shifts to where life has taken us. There’s a warmth in seeing how far we’ve all come, and yet, we’re still those same people at our core. It’s a reminder of roots, of the strength and depth of bonds that time and distance can never fully sever. Even as we talk about new chapters and changes, I realize how much of my past is written in the pages of these friendships.

It feels like being wrapped in a blanket of shared history, and for a moment, I feel grounded again—anchored in who I was, who I am, and who I will always be to these people. The laughter, the ease, the nostalgia—it’s all a kind of reminder that some things, like friendship, never truly change.","Another year with you feels like a gift I get to unwrap every single day.
