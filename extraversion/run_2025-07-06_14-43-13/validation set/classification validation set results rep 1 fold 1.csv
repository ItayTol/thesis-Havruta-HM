28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves.

Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling.
