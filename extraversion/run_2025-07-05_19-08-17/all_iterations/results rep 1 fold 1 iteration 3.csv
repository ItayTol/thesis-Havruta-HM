Emily, Sandra and Beckie - you are the best! 
Lots of stories and pictures were shared and we all thoroughly enjoyed a crazy ride down memory lane. It was great to see you all and see how you all got on in your lives girls!
Can't wait to do this again next year!","A very Happy birthday to my bestie!!! Roy, I want you to know that you are the best thing that ever happened to me. I am so glad we met and I love you unconditionally. I hope you have the best day celebrating your 40th birthday and I'm so here for it. 
You have touched the lives of so many people including mine and we are forever grateful for your optimistic, caring, and kind personality, hope you'll never change!
