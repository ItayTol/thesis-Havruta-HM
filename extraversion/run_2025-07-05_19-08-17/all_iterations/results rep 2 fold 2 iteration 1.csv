28,My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school. Much laughing and getting over how much we had all aged. Looking back at our old school photos was hilarious. Some of us didn't even recognise ourselves. We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event ,The most important person in my life achieves a milestone birthday today. Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together. Unfortunately it's all downhill from here. Buckle up for the coming mid life crisis and keep smiling. These can be the best years of life with the right attitude. Get writing that bucket list and let's see the world ticking them off.,Low,"['IF a person shows in a post evidence of active participation in social gatherings and enjoyment of group activities, THEN extraversion is likely High because this reflects sociability and engagement.', 'IF a person shows in a post that they frequently reference enjoyment in spending time with friends and have a positive outlook on future gatherings, THEN extraversion is likely High because it indicates a preference for socializing and connecting with others.', 'IF a person shows in a post an enthusiastic tone with positive language and punctuation about social events, THEN extraversion is likely High because such expressions signal high energy and excitement for social interactions.']","['My oldest and dearest friends gathered at the weekend to celebrate 30 years since leaving school.', 'We had such a good time that we decided to make this an annual event.', 'Congratulations on your 50th and may we share many more happy years together.']",High,Moderate,"{'Sociability': 1, 'Warmth': 1, 'Energy/Activity': 1}",0,0
