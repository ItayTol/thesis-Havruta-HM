49,"Saw one of my very good friends today! It was quite nostalgic; all those laughter and stories we never get to tell anyone else. He began kidding around and it was like, no time had elapsed and we were back in our childhood or teenage years telling stories of the places we used to hang around. One thing I’ve always grown to appreciate is the ability of friends to know you when you were still young and still support you to date. Thank you to people like this and for creating so many more wonderful memories! Cheers to the uncovered moments.  #Tbt #blessedfriends ","It is another great day for the love of my life, Happy Birthday to you! Today i celebrate you. You always bring so much joy and happiness in to my life, not to mention the patient and constant support. Thanks for every day, all the fun we have, the trips we take, the moments that matters to each of us. Happy anniversary to us yet again, Cheers to many more impressive years together by our side.

57,"Tonight I discovered that if you hang out with a bunch of people who you were friends with in school but haven't seen for approximately.... 30 mumble years...., you will spend a LOT of the time feeling just as awkward as you did when you were a teenager, a LOT of the time comparing your current need for reading glasses and/or perimenopausal symptoms, and a LOT of the time feeling as though you've blocked out half your memories. ","40 today! Happy birthday to S. At what point do you think people will stop saying ""but you look about 12""? ?? Have a great day and I'll see you later for the birthday surprise.

58,Was so great to see my childhood friends at the catch up recently.  So many old faces and memories.  It's so weird how everything has changed but also stayed the same at the same time.  Lucky to still have such a great group and a toast to those that couldn't be with us. Missed and not forgotten. xo ,Well another year older but no wiser just about sums it up!
