50,"What a blast from the past it was last night!   50 years since we all left Morgan and went out into the big wide world.   It was amazing to see some of the old faces, some I barely recognised while with others we went straight back to third year French class!  Awesome to catch up with Brucie, Govie and Tich, but sobering to hear about those who are no longer with us.   Be grateful for every day.","Woo hoo!  Bill is 70!   How did I come to be married to such an old man???   Thank you for putting up with me for all these years and am looking forward to celebrating with you tonight.

53,"As I sit with my childhood friends, the years seem to melt away. The familiar banter, the inside jokes that we’ve carried like treasures through the years, and the way we all seem to pick up right where we left off—it’s like time stands still. I catch myself laughing more freely, feeling that easy comfort I once did when the world seemed so simple. There’s something about being with people who know you in your purest form, before the world shaped you in its various ways.

The conversation flows from old memories—those endless summer days, the mischief we got into, the places we’d hide out—and then shifts to where life has taken us. There’s a warmth in seeing how far we’ve all come, and yet, we’re still those same people at our core. It’s a reminder of roots, of the strength and depth of bonds that time and distance can never fully sever. Even as we talk about new chapters and changes, I realize how much of my past is written in the pages of these friendships.

It feels like being wrapped in a blanket of shared history, and for a moment, I feel grounded again—anchored in who I was, who I am, and who I will always be to these people. The laughter, the ease, the nostalgia—it’s all a kind of reminder that some things, like friendship, never truly change.","Another year with you feels like a gift I get to unwrap every single day. Watching you grow, laugh, and be the incredible person you are fills me with so much pride and gratitude. You are my heart, my best friend, and the person who makes everything brighter just by being you. ??

Thank you for the countless memories we’ve already made and the many more to come. Here’s to celebrating you today (and always), to all your dreams coming true, and to the endless adventures ahead. I’m beyond lucky to walk through life with you by my side. ????

You deserve all the happiness in the world, today and always. I love you more than words could ever say. ?? #BirthdayQueen/King #LuckyToCallYouMine",Moderate,"['IF a person shares a nostalgic reflection about spending time with friends paired with a suggestion for future gatherings in a post THEN extraversion is likely High because it signifies enjoyment of social bonds and a desire to maintain them.', 'IF a person expresses gratitude for friends and reflects on shared experiences in a post THEN extraversion is likely High because it demonstrates social appreciation and connection with others.', 'IF a person expresses excitement about social gatherings in a post THEN extraversion is likely High because it indicates joy in being around others.']","['The post reflects nostalgia and warmth in seeing how far we’ve all come, and mentions talking about new chapters and changes.', ""I express gratitude and pride for my best friend, appreciating the countless memories we've made and looking forward to many more."", 'I look forward to celebrating my best friend and to the endless adventures ahead.']",High,{'Uncategorized': 3},0
54,"so after an exciting wait - we finally all met up , Parsons meads Class of 1987. It had been a while and now we all had a few more wrinkles and grey hairs. The room was full of laughter and hugs and kisses as we all remembered the school days. we had a laugh and caught up with all the news about our families and planned the next catch up.

Good food, excellent drinks and brilliant company. Would definitely recommend the venue we were hanging out in. And the theme was so much fun! I think we looked amazing in our fancy dress.","Congrats Jamie for surviving another year! It's definitely been a wild one between miving in, new job and adopting our first fur baby.

56,Finally back together again! Been far too long since we've seen each other but the three idiots are together and making mischief again at last.

58,Was so great to see my childhood friends at the catch up recently.  So many old faces and memories.  It's so weird how everything has changed but also stayed the same at the same time.  Lucky to still have such a great group and a toast to those that couldn't be with us. Missed and not forgotten. xo ,Well another year older but no wiser just about sums it up!  Happiest of birthdays to my partner in crime! Expanding the birthday out over a whole weekend with drinks and dinner on our weekend getaway. Let's drink great wine and eat all the cake!
