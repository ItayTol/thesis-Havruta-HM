It was amazing to see some of the old faces, some I barely recognised while with others we went straight back to third year French class!  Awesome to catch up with Brucie, Govie and Tich, but sobering to hear about those who are no longer with us.   Be grateful for every day.","Woo hoo!  Bill is 70!
