53,"As I sit with my childhood friends, the years seem to melt away. The familiar banter, the inside jokes that we’ve carried like treasures through the years, and the way we all seem to pick up right where we left off—it’s like time stands still. I catch myself laughing more freely, feeling that easy comfort I once did when the world seemed so simple. There’s something about being with people who know you in your purest form, before the world shaped you in its various ways.

The conversation flows from old memories—those endless summer days, the mischief we got into, the places we’d hide out—and then shifts to where life has taken us. There’s a warmth in seeing how far we’ve all come, and yet, we’re still those same people at our core. It’s a reminder of roots, of the strength and depth of bonds that time and distance can never fully sever. Even as we talk about new chapters and changes, I realize how much of my past is written in the pages of these friendships.

It feels like being wrapped in a blanket of shared history, and for a moment, I feel grounded again—anchored in who I was, who I am, and who I will always be to these people. The laughter, the ease, the nostalgia—it’s all a kind of reminder that some things, like friendship, never truly change.","Another year with you feels like a gift I get to unwrap every single day. Watching you grow, laugh, and be the incredible person you are fills me with so much pride and gratitude. You are my heart, my best friend, and the person who makes everything brighter just by being you. ??

Thank you for the countless memories we’ve already made and the many more to come. Here’s to celebrating you today (and always), to all your dreams coming true, and to the endless adventures ahead. I’m beyond lucky to walk through life with you by my side. ????

You deserve all the happiness in the world, today and always. I love you more than words could ever say. ?? #BirthdayQueen/King #LuckyToCallYouMine",Moderate,"['IF a person describes a deep, personal connection in a post without expressing enthusiasm about social engagements THEN extraversion is likely Low because this suggests a focus on intimate relationships over broader social interactions.', 'IF a person focuses on expressing gratitude for close relationships without mentioning social plans or enthusiasm for gatherings in their posts THEN extraversion is likely Low because this indicates a preference for intimacy over extroverted activities.']","['There’s something about being with people who know you in your purest form, before the world shaped you in its various ways.', 'Thank you for the countless memories we’ve already made and the many more to come.']",Low,"{'Warmth': 1, 'Uncategorized': 1}",0

58,Was so great to see my childhood friends at the catch up recently.  So many old faces and memories.  It's so weird how everything has changed but also stayed the same at the same time.  Lucky to still have such a great group and a toast to those that couldn't be with us. Missed and not forgotten. xo ,Well another year older but no wiser just about sums it up!
