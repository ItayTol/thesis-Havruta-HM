49,"Saw one of my very good friends today! It was quite nostalgic; all those laughter and stories we never get to tell anyone else. He began kidding around and it was like, no time had elapsed and we were back in our childhood or teenage years telling stories of the places we used to hang around. One thing I’ve always grown to appreciate is the ability of friends to know you when you were still young and still support you to date.

53,"As I sit with my childhood friends, the years seem to melt away. The familiar banter, the inside jokes that we’ve carried like treasures through the years, and the way we all seem to pick up right where we left off—it’s like time stands still. I catch myself laughing more freely, feeling that easy comfort I once did when the world seemed so simple. There’s something about being with people who know you in your purest form, before the world shaped you in its various ways.

The conversation flows from old memories—those endless summer days, the mischief we got into, the places we’d hide out—and then shifts to where life has taken us. There’s a warmth in seeing how far we’ve all come, and yet, we’re still those same people at our core. It’s a reminder of roots, of the strength and depth of bonds that time and distance can never fully sever. Even as we talk about new chapters and changes, I realize how much of my past is written in the pages of these friendships.

It feels like being wrapped in a blanket of shared history, and for a moment, I feel grounded again—anchored in who I was, who I am, and who I will always be to these people. The laughter, the ease, the nostalgia—it’s all a kind of reminder that some things, like friendship, never truly change.","Another year with you feels like a gift I get to unwrap every single day. Watching you grow, laugh, and be the incredible person you are fills me with so much pride and gratitude. You are my heart, my best friend, and the person who makes everything brighter just by being you. ??

Thank you for the countless memories we’ve already made and the many more to come. Here’s to celebrating you today (and always), to all your dreams coming true, and to the endless adventures ahead. I’m beyond lucky to walk through life with you by my side. ????

You deserve all the happiness in the world, today and always. I love you more than words could ever say. ?? #BirthdayQueen/King #LuckyToCallYouMine",Moderate,"['IF a person shows in a post a tendency to reminisce about past experiences rather than emphasize current engagements, THEN extraversion is likely Low because it suggests a preference for reflection over active social participation.', 'IF a person shows in a post feelings of nostalgia without present action, THEN extraversion is likely Low because it suggests reflection without current social motivation.', 'IF a person shows in a post a focus on deep emotional connections over social activities, THEN extraversion is likely Low because it indicates a preference for intimate, rather than group interactions.']","['The conversation flows from old memories—those endless summer days, the mischief we got into, the places we’d hide out.', 'It feels like being wrapped in a blanket of shared history, and for a moment, I feel grounded again.', 'You are my heart, my best friend, and the person who makes everything brighter just by being you.']",Low,{'Sociability': 3},0
