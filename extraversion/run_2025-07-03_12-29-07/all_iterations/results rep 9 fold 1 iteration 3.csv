55,"Highschool reunion! Had such a blast hanging out with these lovely people. Thank you Annie for organising and getting us all back together for such a fun and frivolous evening. Good food, excellent drinks and brilliant company. Would definitely recommend the venue we were hanging out in. And the theme was so much fun! I think we looked amazing in our fancy dress.","Congrats Jamie for surviving another year! It's definitely been a wild one between miving in, new job and adopting our first fur baby. I feel very lucky to be able to celebrate this birthday with you. Here we are enjoying dinner at the Sky Garden, picture taken by our lovely server for the evening.

56,Finally back together again! Been far too long since we've seen each other but the three idiots are together and making mischief again at last. My cheeks and sides are already hurting from laughing too much. Time to set the world to rights and consume exhorbitant amounts of alcohol. Cheers!,"Happy birthday Big Ears! Just kidding, happy birthday to the loveliest man in the whole wide world! Another year older and just getting cuter (and somehow more silly) with age.

57,"Tonight I discovered that if you hang out with a bunch of people who you were friends with in school but haven't seen for approximately.... 30 mumble years...., you will spend a LOT of the time feeling just as awkward as you did when you were a teenager, a LOT of the time comparing your current need for reading glasses and/or perimenopausal symptoms, and a LOT of the time feeling as though you've blocked out half your memories. ","40 today! Happy birthday to S. At what point do you think people will stop saying ""but you look about 12""? ?? Have a great day and I'll see you later for the birthday surprise.
