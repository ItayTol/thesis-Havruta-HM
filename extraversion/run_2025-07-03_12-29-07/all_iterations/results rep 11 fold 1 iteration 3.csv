50,"What a blast from the past it was last night!   50 years since we all left Morgan and went out into the big wide world.   It was amazing to see some of the old faces, some I barely recognised while with others we went straight back to third year French class!  Awesome to catch up with Brucie, Govie and Tich, but sobering to hear about those who are no longer with us.   Be grateful for every day.","Woo hoo!  Bill is 70!

56,Finally back together again! Been far too long since we've seen each other but the three idiots are together and making mischief again at last.

58,Was so great to see my childhood friends at the catch up recently.  So many old faces and memories.  It's so weird how everything has changed but also stayed the same at the same time.  Lucky to still have such a great group and a toast to those that couldn't be with us. Missed and not forgotten. xo ,Well another year older but no wiser just about sums it up!  Happiest of birthdays to my partner in crime! Expanding the birthday out over a whole weekend with drinks and dinner on our weekend getaway. Let's drink great wine and eat all the cake!
